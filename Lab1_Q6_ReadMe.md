Lab 1 Q6 has a sequence of LEDs triggered by a  button press. This button press also stops the sequence from repeating infinitely.
Claud helped me with getting the buttons to work because I got stuck. I initially tried using the interrupt format we did in class, but I couldn't get it to work.
This program only seems to work half the time. Without changing the code, sometimes works and sometimes doesn't.
