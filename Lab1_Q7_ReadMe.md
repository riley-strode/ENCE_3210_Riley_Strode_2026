Lab 1 Q7 is a calculator program. It takes two arrays and uses buttons to determine the mathematical operation used for the numbers in each array. The result of this operation is then saved to a new array.
LEDs show the operation being used, as well as the state the program is in.
I used Claud to help me with this program too. I got stuck with the buttons again.
